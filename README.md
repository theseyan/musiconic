# About
`musiconic` is a CLI tool that can scan your entire MP3 directory and auto-populate the files with ID3-compliant tags and artwork, on a best-effort basis based on whatever info it can find on the internet.

It was originally written to enrich my massive MP3 collection with metadata; however it's important to note that the tool frequently generates wrong information if the MP3 data is not sufficient.
